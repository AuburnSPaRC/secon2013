Principles of Path Planning
January 29, 2013
---------------------------

MASTER PATH PLANNING
1) Will be done on base station
2) Calcuates Position of Mobile Unit (vision and LIDAR <-> encoders/mouse)
3) Sends position, destination, and end action to mobile unit
4) May break goal into simpler steps, as mobile unit will be taking simple path from position and destination
5) Optimizes picking up two blocks at a time and dropping off in reverse order
6) Will handle error messages from mobile unit.
7) Will begin air sequence with time remaining.

MOBILE UNIT PATH PLANNING
1) If not communication can be heard, the mobile unit must be able to (less optimally) make some progress with the course.
2) Receives position, destination, and end action from base
3) Plans path only based on these and a few flags received from mobile unit.
4) Tracks encoder and mouse data to estimate location.
5) Performs end action with sensors.
6) Reports location for encoders/mouse.
7) In case of error, report to base.
